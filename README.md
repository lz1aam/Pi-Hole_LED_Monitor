# Pi-Hole_LED_Monitor

Super simple Pi-Hole LED activity monitor for Raspberry Pi Zero. 

Bi-color LED is used to generate 3 colors, green, orange and red. 

Always use current limiting resistors for the LEDs.

The information for the status is scraped by tail from pihole.log.

The script works like a charm, feel free to experiment by yourself.
